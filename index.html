        Project was started with an idea of creating social platform for players of EVE Online. A
        place
        where players could connect and share their experiences, fan art, images, videos, thoughts,
        propaganda...
      </p>
      <p>
        Each "user" would be an actual EVE Online character and you could only login using game's
        credentials (SSO), this way characters could interact outside of eve online. Alliances and
        corporations could share propaganda videos/art and gather followers who could re-share and
        spread the word.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whole platform would heavily relay on EVE Online API, so that you could send in game emails,
        money, create events (calendar). It would feel as an extension of game itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        Think of it as combination of r/eve and twitter. A hub for EVE Online community.
